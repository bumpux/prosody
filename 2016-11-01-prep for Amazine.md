## Prep for Amazin

OK structure the day Friday

1. get the commute right
2. 45 minute meetings in the morning 
3. 1 hour portfolio review at noon 
4. don't plan on lunch 
5. three or more 45-minute meetings in the afternoon 
6. follow up with tomorrow on the commute home

Work backwards
Block portfolio review as a narrative cover xpn and load balancing
Have very short intro / resume using The Groovy reveal slides to suggest you're okay who is running some technology on your laptop
Move from there in the portfolio review in Keynote. prepare two examples for each of the leadership principles
